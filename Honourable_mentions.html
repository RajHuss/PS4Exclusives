    <h1> Honourable Mentions</h1>
    <p> Ah, the Playstation 4. One of the greatest consoles to ever be released by the video game titans at Sony. 
        Since the launch back in 2013, we have had 7 great years filled with blockbuster AAA titles, indie gems and 
        incredible exclusives</p>
    <p> As the new generation of consoles begin to takeover, I decided to take a look back at three of my favourite console exclusive 
        titles from the PS4, highlighting what makes them so special and why no one should miss out 
        on experiencing the games for themselves!</p>
    <p> While you read, bear in mind that I have only considered games that I have completed. Therefore if you’re wondering why games 
        such as Ghost of Tsushima, Death Stranding and God of War are no where to be seen, its because I haven’t got 
        round to playing them yet.</p>
    <p> However, before we delve into my top 3 picks, I’d like to showcase some honourable mentions. </p>
    <h4> The Last of Us</h4>
    <img src="images_and_gifs/wp1811272.jpg" alt="TLOU" width = 25%>
    <p> Technically not an exclusive as the original version released on the PS3. However, it is the 
        Remastered PS4 version that really brings Naughty Dogs vision to life. TLOU is a story driven, 3rd person survival horror game 
        like no other. The Narrative follows Joel and Ellie as they embark on a journey through apocalyptic America 
        fighting against both the infected and humans while making some tough moral decisions along the way as 
        they try to make sense of their new reality.</p>
    <h4> The Order: 1886</h4>
    <img src="images_and_gifs/the-order-1886-cast-header.jpg" alt="1886" width = 25%>
    <p> Now this, is a controversial pick. When this first released it garnered a lot of negative attention and reviews due to it 
        being a single player game that was only 6-10hrs long depending on difficulty. This was a problem at the time because 
        there was no multiplayer component and it was being charged at full price. However, now that you can get it for the price 
        of a cheeky Nandos, its more than worth a punt as no other game released has excelled at cinematic storytelling as well 
        as this. This 3rd person shooter is set in a neo-Victorian setting with a classic tale of Vampires vs Werewolves vs the
        Royal Guard. If you’re looking for a short, gripping, action packed adventure, look no further.</p>
    <img src="images_and_gifs/until-dawn-listing-thumb-01-us-12aug14.png" alt="UntilDawn" width = 25%>
    <p> Ever wanted to be in control of who lives and dies in your favourite teen horror flick? 
        No? Well with Until Dawn you can anyway. Until Dawn follows a group of friends who decide to spend the night at a 
        secluded cabin out in the snowy mountains. What go could go wrong? Depending on your choices, it could be everything. </p>
